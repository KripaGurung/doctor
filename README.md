# DoctorHub â€“ Doctor Appointment System

**DoctorHub** is a solo-developed web application created as a Final Year Project (FYP). It is designed to connect freelance doctors with patients through a streamlined appointment system. The platform allows doctors to apply for listing, and patients to browse, book, and consult with doctors online.

Built using React, Node.js, and MongoDB, DoctorHub offers a smooth user experience with clearly defined roles for admins, doctors, and patients.

- Patients can sign up, log in, and manage their profiles.
- Patients request appointments; doctors accept or reject them. Payments are done only after approval.
- Real-time communication between doctors and patients.
- Doctors can upload and share medical records with patients.
- Patients can rate and review doctors after appointments.
